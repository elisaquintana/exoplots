## Periodâ€“Radius Distribution for Confirmed and Candidate Planets

{% include period_radius_candidates_embed.html %}

This interactive figure shows all the currently confirmed transiting exoplanets
along with planet candidates from the three major transit missions.
If the tap tool is on, clicking on a particular planet will open its appropriate
details page on either Exoplanet Archive or ExoFOP-TESS. Clicking on the
labels in the legend allows you to turn on and off individual collections of
planets.
